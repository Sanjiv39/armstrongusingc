USING C language to print whether the given number is armstrong or not
What is Armstrong no?
Ex, if 153 is a number, here there are 3 digits and if the sum of every digit-raised to power of no of digits is equal to the number itself then it is an armstrong number
1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 , hence 153 is an armstrong number.
